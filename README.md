The Tkinter, PyGame, and OS Module
 #To build the music player, you require the Tkinter, PyGame, and the OS module. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python you can use to create desktop applications. It offers a variety of widgets like buttons, labels, and text boxes so you can develop apps in no time. 
 #Begin by importing the Tkinter, PyGame, and OS modules. Define a class, MusicPlayer. Define the __init__ constructor that the program calls at the time of object creation.
 Define a LabelFrame that will contain the songttrack label and the trackstatus label. Labelframe acts as a container and displays the labels inside a border area. Set the parent window you want to place the frame in, the text it should display, the font styles, the background color, the font color, the border width, and the 3D effects outside the widget.

Use the place() method to organize the frame. Define two labels, songtrack and trackstatus. Customize them and use the grid() manager to organize them in rows and columns format. You can set the songtrack to be present in the first row and add some padding to avoid overlap and make the design more beautiful.
